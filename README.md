# Welcome to Lookbook Shopify Performance

- [The Lookbook Demo](https://tt-kozak-group.myshopify.com/)

# The Logic
- I implemented product adding through 'Theme settings', because I assumed that for such a Lookbook section we will need static products for all places where Lookbookk will appear.

- So through adding the Lookbook section in the customizer you can simply manipulate with product selector directly

- JS file you can find in assets/lookbook.js
- liquid file stored in sections/lookbook.liquid
- CSS file in the same assets/lookbook.css
